🚀 Multi-Tool MCP Server Suite

This repository provides a collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers designed to extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini.

These servers enable LLMs to securely interact with:

Local development environments

File systems

Git repositories

PostgreSQL databases

📦 Servers Included
🔹 Git Server

Provides full control over Git repositories:

Track changes

Manage branches

View commit history

Perform diffs

🔹 Filesystem Server

Enables safe and structured interaction with the local file system:

File reading & searching

Directory traversal

Metadata retrieval

Controlled write operations

🔹 PostgreSQL Server

Provides secure, read-only access to PostgreSQL databases:

Schema introspection

SQL querying

🛠 Tool Reference
1️⃣ Git Server
Tool	Description	Key Inputs
git_status	View working tree status	repo_path
git_add	Stage files for commit	repo_path, files[]
git_commit	Record changes	repo_path, message
git_diff_unstaged	View unstaged changes	repo_path
git_diff_staged	View staged changes	repo_path
git_log	Show commit history	repo_path, max_count, start_timestamp
git_create_branch	Create a new branch	branch_name, base_branch
git_checkout	Switch branches	branch_name
git_branch	List branches	branch_type
2️⃣ Filesystem Server
✅ Read Operations (Safe)
Tool	Description
read_text_file	Read file contents (supports head/tail limits)
read_media_file	Read images/audio as Base64
list_directory_with_sizes	Directory listing with size & stats
directory_tree	Recursive directory structure (JSON)
search_files	Glob-style recursive search
get_file_info	File metadata (size, permissions, timestamps)
⚠️ Write Operations (Guided by MCP Hints)
Tool	Description
write_file	Create or overwrite files (Destructive/Idempotent)
edit_file	Pattern-based editing (Use dryRun: true first)
create_directory	Ensure directory exists (Idempotent)
move_file	Move or rename files (Destructive)
3️⃣ PostgreSQL Server
Tool	Description
query	Execute SQL queries

🔒 Note: This server is configured for read-only access to ensure data safety.

🔐 Security Considerations

Filesystem write operations are guided with safety hints.

PostgreSQL access is strictly read-only.

Destructive operations are clearly marked.

Recommended to use dryRun where supported before applying changes.
